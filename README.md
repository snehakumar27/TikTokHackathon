## TikTok Hackathon ##

This project has been done as part of the TikTok Hackathon Challenge 2023 and aims to optimize advertisement moderation. 
Authors: Sneha Kumar, Barnabas Ee, Huang Hongyi

The `ad_moderartion.py` script directly outputs the assignments, given the advertisment and moderators dataset. 
The remaining python notebooks outline our steps of exploration and how we have come up with our final algorithm in the Python script.
